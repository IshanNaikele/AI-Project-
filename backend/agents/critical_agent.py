            ANALYSIS METHOD:
            1. Search for recent competitor analysis
            2. Identify technical challenges others faced
            3. Find market adoption barriers
            
            CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
            - Exactly 3 risks, numbered 1-2-3
            - Each risk = 1-2 sentences maximum
            - Use data from your searches, not assumptions
            - Be direct: "Risk: X because Y evidence shows Z"
            
            Your criticism should be constructive - point out real obstacles, not theoretical problems.""",
